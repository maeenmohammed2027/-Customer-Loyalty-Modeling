# Customer Loyalty Modeling Project

This project analyzes and predicts customer loyalty points for a fictional retailer, **Turtle Games**, combining **Python** and **R** to deliver actionable insights.  
It simulates a real-world customer analytics workflow, applying **statistical modeling, clustering, and sentiment analysis** to improve loyalty programs through **data-driven segmentation** and **targeted campaigns**.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in both Python and R  
- **Customer Segmentation** with K-means clustering  
- **Loyalty Prediction** using Decision Tree Regression & Linear Models  
- **Visualizations**: Pairplots, 3D scatter plots, boxplots, and distribution charts  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Word clouds & polarity scoring from customer reviews  
- **Combined Python & R Workflow** for a comprehensive analysis  

## Tools & Libraries

**Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TextBlob, WordCloud  
**R**: ggplot2, forecast, scatterplot3d, psych, moments  

## Repository Structure

- `/notebooks` â€“ Jupyter Notebooks (Python)  
- `/R_scripts` â€“ R scripts for EDA and modeling  
- `/plots` â€“ Visual assets generated during analysis  
- `/report` â€“ Final project report (DOCX)  

## Results & Business Insights

- High income and spending strongly predict loyalty â€” but some high-income customers remain under-engaged, offering retention opportunities.  
- Clustering revealed **five distinct customer segments**, enabling tailored marketing strategies.
