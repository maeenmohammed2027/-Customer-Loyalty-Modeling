# ---- Summary of EDA Findings ----
# - Loyalty Points Distribution is right-skewed, with most customers earning moderate points.
# - Spending Score and Remuneration show positive associations with Loyalty Points.
# - Customers with Basic education earn the highest average loyalty points.
# - Loyalty trends appear consistent across genders, with similar upward patterns.
# - Younger age groups (18â€“30) might respond more strongly to loyalty programs.

# Prepare regression dataset
df_regression <- clean_df %>%
  select(age, remuneration, spending_score, loyalty_points, product)
head(df_regression)

# Correlation Analysis
corPlot(df_regression)
# âž¤ The correlation plot reveals strong positive relationships between 
# remuneration, spending_score, and loyalty_points.
# âž¤ These variables are selected as predictors for the regression model.

# Build multiple linear regression model
model01 <- lm(loyalty_points ~ remuneration + spending_score, data = df_regression)
summary(model01)

# Build simpler model using only spending_score
model02 <- lm(loyalty_points ~ spending_score, data = df_regression)
summary(model02)
# âž¤ The simpler model has lower explanatory power (Adj. RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.45),
# confirming that remuneration adds significant predictive value.

# ðŸ“Œ Business Insights Summary

# This analysis evaluated whether customer loyalty points could be predicted using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. 
# Correlation analysis identified remuneration and spending_score as strong predictors. 
# The full model achieved an adjusted RÂ² of approximately 0.65, indicating good predictive power.

# Predictions for new fictional customers aligned with expected behaviorâ€”those with higher income and spending showed higher loyalty scores.
# A simpler model using only spending_score performed significantly worse, confirming that both predictors add value.

# The loyalty programme appears to reward high-value customers effectively. 
# To improve inclusiveness and engagement, the model could be expanded to include non-monetary factors such as product category, platform use, or customer tenure. 
# Future iterations using advanced models (e.g., random forests) could further improve accuracy.

# Marketing strategies should focus on high-spending customers with mid-to-high remuneration, as these segments show the strongest loyalty potential.

#ðŸ“Š R Analysis: Loyalty Points Prediction
#Summary

#This R-based analysis explored customer loyalty patterns and built predictive models using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

#Data Preparation: Cleaned dataset by removing irrelevant variables and renaming columns for clarity.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  
#Loyalty points are right-skewed, with most customers earning moderate points.

#Both spending score and remuneration show strong positive relationships with loyalty points.

# Customers with Basic education level recorded the highest average loyalty points.

# Gender differences in loyalty trends are minimal, but younger age groups (18â€“30) show slightly stronger responses to loyalty programs.

## Modeling:
  
#The full regression model using both remuneration and spending score achieved an adjusted RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.65, indicating good predictive power.

# A simpler model using only spending score performed significantly worse (Adj. RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.45), confirming that both predictors add value.

# Predictions for fictional customers aligned with expectations â€” higher income and spending led to higher predicted loyalty.

## Business Recommendations

# Target High-Value Segments: Focus marketing and loyalty program incentives on customers with mid-to-high remuneration and high spending scores, as they demonstrate the strongest loyalty potential.

# Improve Inclusiveness: Consider enhancing loyalty rewards for lower-income but engaged customers to broaden participation.

# Expand Model Variables: Incorporate additional predictors such as product category, customer tenure, and purchase frequency to improve prediction accuracy.

# Monitor and Iterate: Periodically re-evaluate the model to ensure it reflects evolving customer behaviors, and test advanced models (e.g., Random Forest) for potential performance gains.
